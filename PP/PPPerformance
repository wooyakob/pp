## Correctness:

There aren't any noticeable issues with the schema definitions that would result in incorrect data. 

## Speed:

Indexes are only created on primary key columns.

## Memory Usage:

The data types seem appropriate for each column. There are no large chunks of text.

## Additional Questions:

### Are the column data types suitable?

The column data types seem suitable. They are selected based on the nature of the data to be stored.

### Can the queries be simplified?

The complexity of the queries depends on application requirements.

### Which columns are worth indexing?

If there are columns which are frequently used in WHERE clauses of SQL queries or to join tables - those should be indexed e.g.

- `employee.department_id` - if queries often need to filter or join on the department of employees
- `assignment.employee_id` and `assignment.project_id` - if there are frequent queries accessing assignments based on the employee or project
